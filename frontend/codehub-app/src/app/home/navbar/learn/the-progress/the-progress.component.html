<h3> Project </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>We create real case projects for you. We get ideas from companies working on interesting projects and products and we transfer their needs in cutting-edge projects for you, to work on. You will face a real business problem and design a new product, a new feature or a new system using all the technologies you will learn during our code.learn lessons.</p>

<p> Our scope is to understand all the new stuff by applying your knowledge. You and your team will have to complete a very demanding but also an interesting project, by using the Agile Methodology, get guidance from your mentor and your tech expert. By the end of the lessons, you will have not only gained fundamental knowledge but also, hands-on experience in a challenging project in a real working team. Also, you and your team will have to pitch your idea/project and show your work to the tech directors, mentors, and your academic director. </p>
